# Hospital-Management-System
Mini project of Sem 2, Batch 2024, PCCOE
With hard work from the whole team and multiple testing iterations, here's a Simple Hospital Management C Program, capable of storing, accessing and modifying records of patients and medical staff, and with properly distributed access permissions to Administrator, Staff and Patients. Contains basic encryption for passwords as all the records are saved in text files.

Even though it's quite simple and basic when compared to the huge projects done by coders of our age groups, it still has a special place in my heart as it was my first properly functioning full application. It felt great presenting it to the invigilator and my friends ðŸ™‚.
