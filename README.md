<h2>App Structure</h2>
<p>This app is for hospitals, where hospital staff manages the patient database through this software. The user base is made of three types of users:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    <strong>Admin</strong> (with all necessary admin controls, currently restricted to only one admin)
    </li>
    <li>
    <strong>User</strong> (Hospital Staff who manages the data, this userbase is managed by admin)
    </li>
    <li>
    <strong>Patient</strong> (It is the list of information about a patient, added/modified/removed by users)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Admin can modify Hospital Information and add/Remove Users. Users can modify/remove themselves, and add/modify/edit patients' info. To avoid any confusion, this app is not for patients to use. So, there is no login for patients. Instead, hospital staff can access/modify the patients' information.</p>
