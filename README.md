    ## App Structure

    This app is for hospital, where hospital staff manages the patient database through this software. The userbase is made of three types of users:

    - Admin (with all necessary admin controls, currently restricted to only one admin)
    - User  (Hospital Staff who manages the data, this userbase is managed by admin)
    - Patient (It is the list of information about a patient, added/modified/removed by users)

    Admin can modify Hospital Information, Add/Remove Users. User can modify/remove himself, add/modify/edit patients info. To avoid any confusion, this app is not for patients to use. So, there is no login for patients. Instead, hospital staff can access/modify the patients' information.
